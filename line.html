    <h1>This is a Main Heading</h1>
    <h2>This is a Subheading</h2>
    <h3>A smaller heading</h3>

    <p>This is a standard paragraph of text. You can use paragraphs to organize your content into logical blocks.</p>

    <p>This paragraph contains some <b>bold text</b> and some <i>italicized text</i>. You can also use <strong>strong</strong> for important text and <em>emphasized</em> for emphasis.</p>

    <p>To create a line break within a paragraph, use the <br> tag.<br>This text will appear on a new line.</p>

    <p>Here's a blockquote for quoting content from another source:</p>
    <blockquote>
        "The only way to do great work is to love what you do." - Steve Jobs
    </blockquote>

    <p>Here's some preformatted text, which preserves spaces and line breaks:</p>
    <pre>
        This text
            is preformatted,
        so it retains its
            original spacing.
    </pre>

    <p>You can also include code snippets like <code>console.log("Hello, World!");</code> using the <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tag.</p>

    <p>For keyboard input, use <kbd>Ctrl + S</kbd> to save.</p>

    <p>This text includes a <del>deleted</del> and <ins>inserted</ins> portion.</p>

    <p><small>This is smaller text.</small></p>
